# confy-ruby

Official Confy API library client for ruby

__This library is generated by [alpaca](https://github.com/pksunkara/alpaca)__

## Installation

Make sure you have [rubygems](https://rubygems.org) installed

```bash
$ gem install confyio
```

#### Versions

Works with [ 1.8.6 / 1.8.7 / 1.9.1 / 1.9.2 / 1.9.3 / 2.0.0 / 2.1.0 / 2.1.1 ]

## Usage

There are two ways of loading the config.

 * You can either load it as a hash object with the same structure into a variable.
 * Or you can load it directly into `ENV` with the key formed by concatenizing the path keys with underscores.

```ruby
require "confyio"

# When the config is
# => { 'port': 6000, 'db': { 'pass': 'sun' } }

# Using URL
Confy::Config.env("https://user:pass@api.confy.io/orgs/company/project/app/envs/production")

# or using options hash
Confy::Config.env({
  'host': 'https://api.confy.io', 'user': 'user', 'pass': 'pass',
  'org': 'company', 'project': 'app', 'env': 'production'
});

# ['port']
ENV['PORT'] # => 6000

# ['db']['pass']
ENV['DB_PASS'] # => 'sun'
```


```ruby
# Retrieve the config using URL
config = Confy::Config.load('https://user:pass@api.confy.io/orgs/company/project/app/envs/production')

# or using options hash
config = Confy::Config.load({
  :host => 'https://api.confy.io', :user => 'user', :pass => 'pass',
  :org => 'company', :project => 'app', :env => 'production'
})

config['port'] # => 6000
config['db']['pass'] # => 'sun'

# Or you could instantiate a client to work with other api (as shown below)
```

### Build a client

__Using this api without authentication gives an error__

##### Basic authentication

```ruby
auth = { :username => 'pksunkara', :password => 'password' }

client = Confy::Client.new(auth, client_options)
```

### Client Options

The following options are available while instantiating a client:

 * __base__: Base url for the api
 * __api_version__: Default version of the api (to be used in url)
 * __user_agent__: Default user-agent for all requests
 * __headers__: Default headers for all requests
 * __request_type__: Default format of the request body

### Response information

__All the callbacks provided to an api call will receive the response as shown below__

```ruby
response = client.klass('args').method('args', method_options)

response.code
# >>> 200

response.headers
# >>> {'x-server' => 'apache'}
```

##### JSON response

When the response sent by server is __json__, it is decoded into a hash

```ruby
response.body
# >>> {'user' => 'pksunkara'}
```

### Method Options

The following options are available while calling a method of an api:

 * __api_version__: Version of the api (to be used in url)
 * __headers__: Headers for the request
 * __query__: Query parameters for the url
 * __body__: Body of the request
 * __request_type__: Format of the request body

### Request body information

Set __request_type__ in options to modify the body accordingly

##### RAW request

When the value is set to __raw__, don't modify the body at all.

```ruby
body = 'username=pksunkara'
# >>> 'username=pksunkara'
```

##### JSON request

When the value is set to __json__, JSON encode the body.

body = {'user' => 'pksunkara'}
